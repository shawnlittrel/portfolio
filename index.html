            <p>Personal History -- Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

                I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

                Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
                
                You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? You've swallowed a planet! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!
                
                It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!
                
                I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

                You've swallowed a planet! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
                
                I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.
                
                You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

                *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
                
                You've swallowed a planet! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
