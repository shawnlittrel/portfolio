# Personal Portfolio

**Description**
---
A site coded with HTML and CSS to show my personal and work history, examples of my work, and various ways to get in touch with me.  This site is a work in progress, and will evolve with me as I become more versed in full stack web development.

**About Me**
---
I wanted to give a good idea of how I got to where I am today, as well as what drives me to succeed in my professional life.  I feel these are best contained in a "personal" section - what brought me to Phoenix and my family that I want to provide for - as well as a "professional" section - a way to demonstrate my aptitude for learning, problem solving, and troubleshooting.

**My Work**
---
Each piece of work has two pieces: a screenshot and a title.  Clicking the screenshot will bring the user to the live version of the application, where they can explore the finished product.  Clicking the title of the piece will bring the user to the Github repository for that particular piece, where they can examine the code and find the README file that will give further information.

**Contact Me**
---
Each method of contact is a link that the user can click on to directly interact with me.
