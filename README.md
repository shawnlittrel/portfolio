# Personal Portfolio

**Description**
---
This site has been completely rebuilt and revamped with React! Included are sections for "About Me", "Portfolio", "Resume", and "Contact".

**About Me**
---
I have included 3 columns here: one to quickly display my skills and certifications, one that expands upon me as a person, and one to walk though my work experience.  These three columns sum up my road to get where I am today, and provide a quick overview of what a potential employer would get upon hire.

**Portfolio**
---
A partial list of projects I have created.  Users can filter through the projects with the buttons on the left-hand side as well as click each card to access more information about each.  Inside each project's modal is a short summary of the project, what specific tools the project was made with, and links to the GitHub repo and live app (if available).

**Resume**
---
A generic version of my resume that gives more of a traditional, short-form look at my skills, work, and education.

**Contact Me**
---
A form to send me an email.  There are also links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles in a persistent footer at the bottom of the page.
