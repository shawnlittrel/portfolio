            <h3>Personal History</h3>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>I grew up in the Midwest, and after visiting my aunt in Phoenix, it became my dream to live there.  I graduated high school in 2004 and attended college at the University of South Dakota.  
                After working on my degree in Speech Communication, I  realized that there were no job prospects that I wanted.  Eventually I moved to Davenport, IA and started working on my degree in Electronics Engineering.
                <br />
                <br />
                I picked up skills in general electronics, computers, industrial automation, and radio technology.  While in school, I gained employment at Per Mar Security and have been in the residential low-voltage industry ever since.  
                I moved to Phoenix in 2015 to work with Safeguard Security.  In 2016, I met my wife, Laura.  We began our family in October, 2018, with the birth of our son, Finley.  2019 brought another big change, as we chose 
                to buy a house and put down permanent roots in Glendale, AZ.  In late 2020, I decided to return to school in order to better provide for my family as well as find a career that is gentler on my body.  
                I chose web development because of my lifelong passion for computers and the internet.  
                <br />
                <br />
                When I'm not working, I spend time playing with my son or taking him around town to do errands.  Laura and I do home improvement together and follow a TV show when we have time.  
                We get together with my mom and aunt every week for dedicated family time.  My hobbies - when I have time - are buiding computers, mechanical keyboards, woodworking, and brewing my own beer.  
                Pre-pandemic, I loved to try new Mexican restaurants, and hope to continue that tradition when it is safe to do so once again.

            <h3> Work History</h3>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>  From 2013-2017, I focused on residential security and smart home products.  I learned the ins and outs of the field and eventually became an Project Manager at Safeguard Security in 2016.
                <br />
                <br />
                I wanted to push myself more into smart home programming, so I left Safeguard and went to Lanza AV in 2017, where I became a certified Savant and Control4 programmer.  
                Since then I have spent most of my time in high-value luxury homes, creating a "single pane of glass" experience for my clients.  I automate and integrate LAN, home theater products, lighting, pools, shades, fireplaces, and motorized accessories
                into a single app that gives clients granular control over their entire home.  I also develop the UI/UX for them to view their home in an intuitive and convenient way.
                <br />
                <br />
                Even though I am new to web development, my past experience has proven me to be a fast and eager learner.  I thrive on challenging myself to pick up new skills and polish old ones.
                I have realized that when I don't push myself to keep learning, I become complacent and my work suffers for it.  I believe that the fast-changing world of web development will be a great way
                for me to continuously learn and master new skills.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since starting at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, I have found that I pick up this new information fairly quickly and really enjoy doing it.  When I sit down to work on a particular
                assignment, the time seems to fly by while I problem-solve and research ways to accomplish what I want to do.  I hope that my work below shows my committment to excellence.
